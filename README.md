# Peerplay

### Peerplay is an Open Source project based on Switch Lan Play developed by spacemeowx2, it brings changes to fix some flaws of the original project, in addition to other features

###### Switch Lan Play is a client - server system, without modification only clients connected to the same server could play together

###### Peerplay goes further by implementing an additional layer allowing the server (whether it is stored locally or not) to communicate in Peer to Peer with the other Peerplay servers on the Internet, moreover Peerplay has optional functionalities allowing optimize connections to ensure optimal performance during gaming sessions and in the long term will integrate features to allow

- to interconnect emulators and physical consoles
- to use external projects (like Super Mario Odyssey Online for example) through Peerplay

###### In the long term, Peerplay's objective is to integrate functionalities equivalent to those of official online services without using any reverse engineering, starting with the most basic tools (request for friends, internal messaging, invitations, private party ...) to turn this project into a sustainable and legal alternative to the official game server
